🌱 Wysdom is a collaboration platform for web3 development and publishing. Its goal is to offer an all-in-one space for smart contract development, dApp prototyping, transaction analysis, on-chain exploration and knowledge sharing. It achieves this by utilising composable, shareable, and ownable interactive computational notebook, i.e. web documents that contain a mix of rich Markdown, charts, executable code and its corresponding output.

🌱 It is a development sandbox and publishing platform offering a unified workspace, allowing users to discover, interact with, comment on and fork different notebooks, to form a collective web3 knowledge base.

## ⁉️ Problem

- What’s the problem?
    - Information is fragmented across many tools and sources. Switching between these different tools, like block explorers, dApps, wallets, analytics platforms, GitHub and IDEs is unorganised and may create efficiency loss.
    
    Examples:
    
    - For example, when analysing a transaction one might have to open many different tabs at once, each contributing a small percentage of the overall workflow.
    - Another scenario is when wanting to share a piece of smart contract with someone, one might need a couple of tools to share, configure, and execute it, another tool just to leave feedback, and another tool again just to complete the circle, all of which is done in isolation, without the users being able to directly see what each other is doing.

## 🔎 Solution 
 - What is the solution?
    - By utilising a notebook format, Wysdom is able to consolidate all the tools in one place: Users can seamlessly write, execute, collaborate and share code all within one web-based environment.
    - Rather than switching between tools, Wysdom integrates existing toolkits, from oracles, to testing frameworks, to deployment, therefore minimising context switching.
    - Wysdom combines a powerful developer/researcher toolset with a social platform, creating a distinctive experience that fosters meaningful content creation and sharing within the web3 ecosystem.
